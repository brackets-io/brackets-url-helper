This is an extension for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor.

It is very common to include urls in your project for future reference. But if you need to acces those urls, you have to copy them and paste into browser's address bar. This extension simplify that process. If you right-click on "http" Or "https" from your Brackets, it will select the entire url and give you an option to go to that link.
